                                   "<path to vault dir>")
  ;;register your vaults

** nth-roam-select-vault

 - completing read followed by context switch for roam-db and roam-dir
 - I map it to "spc n r v a"
 - proceed as usual with your org-roam ops post switch

** nth-roam-yield-current-vault

 - If you happen to forget the current vault you're in
 - I map it to "spc n r v v"
 - shows the current vault in the minibuffer
